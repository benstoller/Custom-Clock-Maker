This program takes events which occur over a specific interval of time and converts those intervals into a clock. The new clock now exists with these events replacing things likes seconds, minutes, hours, etc. For example, the average person types a character every .3 seconds. Usain Bolt ran his world record 100m dash in 9.58 seconds. It takes 12 minutes to boil an egg. So if 37 minutes and 28 seconds of time passed while this new clock was running, it would read 3 egg batches, 9 world record 100m dashes, and 5 typed characters.


How it works:

1.Use the Add Time Interval button to add the desired amount of intervals you wish to use in the clock

-The remove button next to each interval can remove that interval.

2.For each interval:

	a. Enter the name.
  
	b. Enter the length.
  
	c.Select the appropriate current time standard from the dropdown list.
  
3. Click the Create Time Standard button

*The Edit Time Standard button allows you to modify your current time intervals.

*The Create New Time Standard button allows you to start a new clock from scratch.



About:

My name is Ben Stoller and I am a junior computer science major at James Madison University. This program was created for JMU’s Honors 300 It’s About Time class. I chose to pursue this project because I thought it would be intriguing to be able to visualize how different intervals of time pass, and I thought a clock would be a great way to do that. If you run into any issues with this program, please contact me at stollebh@dukes.jmu.edu.
